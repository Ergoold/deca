deca (from desk calculator) is a simple utility that reads and evaluates
mathematical expressions.

:: Usage

	deca can be used to evaluate a single expression at the command
	line by giving the expression as an argument to deca:

		$ deca '1 + 1'
		= 2
		$

	When invoked with no arguments, deca starts in REPL mode, allowing
	you to type and evaluate multiple expressions at your terminal:

		$ deca
		deca> 1 + 1
		= 2
		deca> 2^8
		= 256
		deca> ^D
		$

:: Command-Line Options

	deca accepts the following command-line options:

		-c	Activate Clean Mode, which does not print the
			repl prompt or the equals sign before results.

		-i	Activate Interactive Mode, which opens the
			repl. This mode is active by default if no
			non-option command-line arguments are provided.

:: Features

	deca can evaluate any expression using complex numbers, arithmetic
	operators, exponentiation, parentheses, many elementary functions
	and taking absolute values and roots.

	:: Planned

		The following additional features are currently planned:

			- custom constants
			- implicit multiplication
